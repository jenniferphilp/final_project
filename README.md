This app was built with ReactJS and a Node server using the Express module. It is integrated with a MongoDB database, hosted by mLab. 

This app consists of 4 games for early learners and is appropriate for the Ontario Kindergarten curriculum. It is separated into two branches, 
literacy and numeracy. 

It is currently still being modified for tablet and mobile use.
